# AppX - Empowering Sentiment Analysis with GPT-03

# This project utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to develop a sentiment analysis system for determining product star ratings from customer reviews. It involves data preprocessing, model evaluation, and backend development.

The objective is to accurately analyze customer sentiment in reviews and assign appropriate star ratings. The model is trained on a large annotated dataset, enabling it to understand the nuances of sentiments expressed in the text.

Precision and recall scores are used to evaluate the model's performance, ensuring its accuracy. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices are implemented to streamline workflow, automate testing, and ensure system stability.

The project report details the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and sentiment extraction using GPT-3. It discusses evaluation metrics and presents precision and recall scores as benchmarks for model performance.

Backend development involves integrating the model with a user-friendly interface and conducting extensive testing to ensure scalability and responsiveness.

In summary, this project delivers a robust sentiment analysis solution for product star ratings, leveraging GPT-3's capabilities. It enhances decision-making, improves customer satisfaction, and provides valuable insights from customer feedback.
